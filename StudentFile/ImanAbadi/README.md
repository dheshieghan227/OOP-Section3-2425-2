## About Me
Hi there! My name is Iman, a second-year student in the data engineering program at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. I love to work with data, specifically in data analysis. I am eager to learn about OOP and the new programming language, Java, and I hope this course will benefit me in understanding the object-oriented programming paradigm better.
